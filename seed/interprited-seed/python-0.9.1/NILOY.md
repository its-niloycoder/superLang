my main gole it to understand the source
but i can optimize python performance

1. poor performance on built in systesm

2. ok, say we have a single source file (meaning noting get imported)
now when that runes, only the builtin module is avalable
so the performance matter for frequently accessed things
so if we can make frequently access things more faster then all over things can get fast
